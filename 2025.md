## About Mautic

[Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/) is the worldâ€™s largest open source marketing automation project. With over 200,000 organisations using Mautic and over 1,000 community volunteers, we empower businesses by making it easy to manage their marketing across a range of channels. 

## What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an annual event encouraging contributions to open source projects. Throughout October, participants are invited to submit contributions to open source repositories like Mautic. Contributions can be code, documentation, design, translations, or community support. This repository was initially created to support the Hacktoberfest event, but we're now using it year-round due to the success of Hacktoberfest.

## Why low- and no-code contributions matter

Open source projects thrive not only from code contributions but also from the community's efforts in other areas. Low- and no-code contributions help Mautic grow and improve through better documentation, translations, community support, and more. If you're not a developer but want to contribute to open source, there are plenty of ways to get involved!

## Ways to contribute

There are several ways to contribute to Mautic without writing code:

### 1. **Documentation**

### 4. **Design and user experience (UX)**

- **Create or improve UI/UX designs**: Work on wireframes, mockups, and designs that improve the user interface of Mautic.
- **Usability testing**: Provide feedback on how Mautic can be more user-friendly by testing features and sharing your insights.

### 5. **Marketing**

    If you're contributing during October, register for Hacktoberfest at [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/) using your GitHub account.

2. **Sign up to contribute to Mautic**

    If you're contributing during October, register to participate in Mautic's Hacktoberfest event by filling out the form here: [Mautic Hacktoberfest 2025 Signup](https://m.mautic.org/hacktoberfest-25-signup). Please indicate **how you'd like to contribute** in the form by selecting areas, such as documentation, translations, design, marketing, or community support.

3. **Join the Mautic community**

   - Visit the [Mautic Forum](https://forum.mautic.org/) to introduce yourself and engage with the community.
   - Join the [Mautic Slack](https://www.mautic.org/slack) for real-time conversations with contributors and the Mautic team.

4. **Pick your contribution type**

    Choose the area where you want to contribute, whether it's documentation, translation, marketing, knowledgebase, or community support.

5. **Find an issue**

    Browse through the **[Mautic Low- and No-Code Issues](https://github.com/orgs/mautic/projects/21/)**. There are specific tags like `documentation`, `design`, or `translation` to help you find no-code contribution opportunities. Use the tabs to navigate between the types of tasks.

6. **Make your contribution**

   - **Documentation**: Review or improve the documentation at [Mautic User Documentation](https://docs.mautic.org/).
   - **Translations**: Get involved by translating at [Mautic Translations](https://www.transifex.com/mautic/mautic/).
   - **Community**: Help in the forums or join conversations on Mauticâ€™s social media platforms.

7. **Submit your contribution**

    For documentation, submit your work via a pull request (PR) on GitHub. If you're contributing in October and participating in Hacktoberfest, be sure to reference Hacktoberfest in your contribution notes so that the team knows to add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label. For other tasks, such as translations or writing on the knowledgebase, follow the submission process on Transifex or the knowledgebase and then follow the steps below to have your contribution validated and counted. 
   
    For low- and no-code contributions where there is no PR to make (e.g. marketing, design, etc.), we've created a file in this repository (named `YYYY.md`; for example, `2025.md`) where we maintain an activity log that allows you to submit a PR (so that it counts for Hacktoberfest and as a Mautic contribution) each time you complete a task.

    ðŸš© **Important note:**
    
    Some teams use Jira, and issues that are completed and assigned to a person are automatically recorded as open source contributions. However, if you want your contributions to count towards Hacktoberfest, you **must create a PR** in this repository.

    ---

    To make a PR to have your contribution counted, follow these steps:

    1. Log in to GitHub with your GitHub account
    2. Go to the main page of [mautic/low-no-code](https://github.com/mautic/low-no-code) repository
    3. Click the "Fork" button at the top right and select your personal account in the "Owner" dropdown menu
    4. In your forked repository, edit the relevant file for the current year, and add your contribution and a link to the issue or PR at the [Ongoing contributions 2025](#ongoing-contributions-2025) section. Follow any instructions that are written regarding the formatting to use
    5. Click the button to commit your changes, and make a new branch (ideally, call it something relevant to this contribution, so you know what each one is)
    6. Go back to the [mautic/low-no-code](https://github.com/mautic/low-no-code) repository
    7. Click the button at the top of the page to make a new pull request
    8. Add the details about your contribution, and submit the pull request for the team to review
    9. Celebrate! ðŸ¥³

    Please follow this process for each contribution to ensure it counts towards Hacktoberfest or Mautic's contributions. The team will add the label `hacktoberfest-accepted` to relevant contributions, which will enable your contributions to be counted.

8. **Get your rewards**

    After contributing to **six** eligible open source repositories during Hacktoberfest, youâ€™ll earn limited-edition Mautic Hacktoberfest digital badges. For other contributions, we're working on unique Holopin badges - watch this space!
